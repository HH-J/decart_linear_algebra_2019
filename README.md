# Principles of Linear Algebra for Data Science

This course introduces students to linear algebra principles that form the
foundation of data science. Students will use Python to write simple programs
to implement linear algebra concepts. Linear algebra concepts will be connected
to important biomedical data science problems, such as text representation.

## Linear Algebra Topics

* Vector and matrix representation and basic mathematical operations
* Vector spaces
* Gaussian elimination
* Basis vectors, dimensionality, norm
* Null space, column space, and row space
* Orthogonal projections
* Least squares

## Python Topics

As part of this class, students will develop a simple Python package that implements vectors, matrices, and linear algebra functions. Because the
objective of the programming is to reinforce linear algebra principles,
programs will be developed from native Python data structures rather than
numpy, which would be used in practice.

## Prerequisities

Students should have prior Python programming experience (such as the
DeCART Python boot camp or equivalent).
